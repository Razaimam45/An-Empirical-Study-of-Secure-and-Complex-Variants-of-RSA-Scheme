# An-Empirical-Study-of-Secure-and-Complex-Variants-of-RSA-Scheme

In today’s cyber space, where large amounts of data are being exchanged and stored on remote storages, Cryptography plays a major role. Public key cryptography such as RSA is one its effective type, which uses two keys, one for encryption
and one for decryption. Concerning the recent advancements in the domain of cryptography, many cryptographers have proposed various extended and enhanced form
of RSA algorithms in order to improve the reliability and efficiency of the information
security world. In this paper, we studied several extended forms of RSA algorithm.
We implemented several and compare them in terms of its efficiency in terms of
key generation, encryption and decryption time. Finally, we suggested a multipoint
parallel RSA scheme to improve the overall algorithm execution speed compared to
standard RSA. This method will also prove to be computationally less costly and
more secure as compared to standard RSA.
